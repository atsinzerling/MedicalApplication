# MedicalApplication
An application that is intended to help medical workers at my school keep track of and notify teachers about sick students.
It was build as an Internal Assessment for an IB Computer Science course.

This is a NetBeans project. If you want to run the jar file without importing the project, you need to copy dist/lib and dist/MailSpammer_gh.jar to the same directory, and then just run the jar file.
